```If you need to populate a dashboard to show what date a file is from for a lookup definition, put the date in YYYYmmdd format. Then modify the eval to fit into your localized format


example:


lookup definition name: myupdates
lookup file name: updatesfile_from_client_20220421.csv

With the above it would output as

04/21/2022

```
